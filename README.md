Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, CNN, VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet50, Transfer Learning

Built and compared multiple deep learning models to classify weather conditions from image data using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project evaluated transfer learning models (VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet50) and a custom CNN, applying extensive data augmentation and evaluation.

Used transfer learning on pre-trained models with custom top layers for image classification.

Applied image preprocessing and augmentation (rotation, zoom, shift, flip) to enhance model generalization.

Compared performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Achieved >90% accuracy on test sets with VGG16 and ResNet50.

Visualized learning curves for model convergence and validation.

Exported final models in .h5 format for production-ready deployment.
